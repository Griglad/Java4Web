# Project 1 - team 3 (javaτζήδες)

This is a team project that was developed within the framework of Regeneration/CodeHub program "Java4Web". 
It is a simple cmd application connecting via JDBC to a MySql database, that performs various tasks (retrieving data,sorting of objects, regex matching, etc).
Most importantly from the engineering point of view, the project is designed and developed using good design patterns and practices.
